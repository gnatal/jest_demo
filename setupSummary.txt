Installing jest:
1) install locally with yarn add --dev jest (or npm)
- note worthy use --dev in everything that you will not ship to production
- since jest isn't a prod package it's better leave as dev dependency

2) install globally with yarn add global jest
2.1) run with jest -> options
2.2) jest -> run all the tests
2.3) jest <file> runs 1 file
2.4) jest <file> --notify --config=<jsonfile>
2.5) jest --init -> create a config file


- note, all this jest commands can be done with yarn test (if you have a test in your package.json)
- ex yarn test file -> jest file

Also this project already have babel installed but it's worth noting that you need to install
Babel to use ES6 syntax. Also you could use TS-Jest to run with typescript
